# Hello-World
Just another one
Littel about me
I enjoy being active in sporting and social arenas and consider myself to a have very positive outlook in everyday life as well as in the workplace.
I have always had the drive to understand the inner workings of most things and from a young age I spent a lot of my spare time in the shed welding bicycles together or building inventive spring loaded basketball rings.
I also had (and still have) a strong urge to fix anything that is broken.
